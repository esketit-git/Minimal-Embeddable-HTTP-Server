# HTTPS Web Server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What Is It?

An synchronous tiny HTTPS web server  that supports HTTP web requests over Secure Socket Layer(SSL) as well as 
PHP, CGI, Python, Perl etc. scripts execution on server sides.

# Compilation

### Dependency

  ##### GCC with C++11 compiler(g++)
  ##### Boost C++ Library
  ##### OpenSSL library

### Step 1: Getting the Source Code

You can download source by command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pritamzope/http_web_server.git
    $ cd http_web_server

or you can get source via other ways you prefer at <https://github.com/pritamzope/http_web_server>

### Step 2: Install OpenSSL

I'm using Ubuntu, 

    $ sudo apt-get install openssl

or you can install manually by downloading source code from https://github.com/openssl/openssl

### Step 4: Generate OpenSSL Certificate and Key

Run gen_openssl_key.sh script to generate HttpsWebServer.cert and HttpsWebServer.cert files.

    $ sh gen_openssl_key.sh
    
following is the key generation example from my terminal:-

    pritam@pzope:~/http_web_server-master$ sh gen_openssl_key.sh 
    Can't load /home/pritam/.rnd into RNG
    140200119943616:error:2406F079:random number generator:RAND_load_file:Cannot open file:../crypto/rand/randfile.c:88:Filename=/home/pritam/.rnd
    Generating a RSA private key
    ......+++++
    ..............+++++
    writing new private key to 'HttpsWebServer.key'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IN
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Maharashtra
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Pune
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:HttpsWebServer
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:HttpsWebServer
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:HttpsWebServer
    Email Address []:


### Step 5: Compile and Run

For compiling source code with TLS/SSL library, i'm using header files location in makefile as '/usr/include/openssl/'.
Run command:

    $ make
    $ ./httpsserver <resource-direcory-path>


## Example

Run server with directory path where all server files will be stored.
e.g.:

    $ ./httpsserver /home/pritam/resource

Open browser and goto https://<ipaddress>:1234/. remebmer https not http.
Browser must be allowed to accept requests from this server. For example, Firefox browser will show following Warning, so go to "Advanced" option and click on "Accept the Risk and Continue".
  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pritamzope/http_web_server/master/https_web_server/images/allow_https_request.png"  width="800" height="500"/>

Some testing examples are given in **test** directory.<br>
Copy the contents of **test** folder into /home/pritam/resource directory.<br>
Now open Web Browser and goto address **127.0.0.1:1234**.<br>
Server uses port 1234 by default which can be changed in source(main.cpp).<br>
It will show following server default page.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pritamzope/http_web_server/master/https_web_server/images/https_web_server_main_page.png" width="640" height="400"/>

That means server is started successfully and ready to serve clients.
Many clients are given in **test** directory such as static HTML pages,PHP, CGI, Python and Perl scripts.

Navigate your browser URL to **127.0.0.1:1234/test.html**, it will show following page for testing each web scripts.<br>
If server is running on another machine then use that machine's IP address.
